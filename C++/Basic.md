The best way to learn a programming language is by writing programs.

Byte

字节，一字节等于八位。

### What is a compiler?

Computers understand only one language and that language 

Because a computer can only understand machine language and humans wish to write in high level languages.

High level languages have to be re-written (translated) into machine language at some point.



Console programs are programs that use text to communicate 

The function named **main** is a special function in all C++ program;

C++ uses a convenient abstraction 

A *stream* is an entity where a program can either insert or extract 

On most program environments, the standard output by default is the screen, and 

### Pointers

Variables 

For a C++ program, the memory of a computer is like a succession of memory cells, each one byte in size, and each with a unique address.



一连串

The address of a variable can be obtained by preceding the name of a variable with an ampersand sign, known as *address-of operator*.

        foo = &myvar;
        
This would assign the address of variable `myvar` to `foo`.

The actual address of a variable in memory cannot be known before runtime.
