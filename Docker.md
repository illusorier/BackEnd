Docker vs Virtual Machine (VM)

![](./assets/vm-vs-docker-architecture.png)

Containers and VMs are similar in their goals: to isolate an application and its dependencies into a self-contained unit that can run anywhere.

### Docker Client

The Docker Client is what you, as the end-user of Docker, communicate with.

Think of it as the UI for Docker.

### Docker Daemon

The Docker daemon is what actually executes commands sent to the Docker Client - like building, running, and distributing your containers.
