## Creating Packages

The types that are part of the Java platform are members of various packages that bundle classes by function: fundamental classes are in *java.lang*, classes for reading and writing (input and output) are in *java.io*.

To create a package, you choose a name for the package and put a *package* statement with that

If you do not use a *package* statement, your type ends up in an unnamed package.

## Using Package Members

The types that comprise a package are known as the *package member*.
