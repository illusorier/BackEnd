和Apache HTTP Server相比，Tomcat能够动态的生成资源并返回到客户端。

Tomcat can be either downloaded and installed, or it can be embedded it into your application as a simple library, as is the typical use by a **Spring Boot application**.

Apache Tomcat is a webcontainer which allows to run servlet and JSP based web applications.

Most of the modern Java web frameworks are based on servlets, e.g. JavaServer Faces, Struts, Spring.

Apache Tomcat also provides by default a HTTP connector on port 8080.

Tomcat can also be used as HTTP server.

But the performance of Tomcat is not as good as the performance of a designated web server, like the Apache HTTP server.
