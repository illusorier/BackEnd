Java is an Object-Oriented Language.

Java有哪些特性去支持“面向对象”？

A class is a blueprint from which individual objects are created.

A class can contain any of following variable types.

- Local variables (局部变量)

- Instance variables (实例变量) - 

- Class variables (类变量)

A class can have any number of methods.

Every class has a constructor.

Modifiers are keywords that you add to those 

### Using the this Keyword

From within a constructor, you can also use the `this` keyword to call another constructor in the same class.

### Static

We can apply java static keyword with variables, methods, blocks and nested class.
