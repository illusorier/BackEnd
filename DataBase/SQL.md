结构化查询语言

> SQL is a standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in database.

CRUD => create, read, update, delete.

A database most often contains one or more tables.

Each table is identified by a name (e.g. "Customers" or "Orders").

Tables contain records (rows) with data.

The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.

The data returned is stored in a result table, called the result-set.

        SELECT column1, column2, ...
        FROM table_name;
        
The WHERE clause is used to filter records.
