Computers can only directly execute the machine code instructions which are part of their instruction set.

Because these instructions are difficult for humans to read,

Because of its performance advantage, today many language implementations execute a program in two phase, first compiling the source code into bytecode, and then passing the bytecode to the virtual machine, like Java and Python.

In computer science, an **interpreter** is a computer program that directly executes, i.e. performs instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without requiring them previously to have been compiled into a machine language program.

Interpretation and compilation are the two main means by which programming languages are implemented.

In computer science, ahead-of-time(AOT) compilation is
