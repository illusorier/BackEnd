计算机是人类发明的一种计算设备，那么，我们可以用它来完成哪些工作呢？

Computers can only directly execute the machine code instructions which are part of their instruction set.

计算机只能理解机器语言并执行它们，但是直接用机器码编写复杂程序的效率相对较低，因此目前绝大多数程序都是用高级语言写成的。

Because of its performance advantage, today many language implementations execute a program in two phase, first compiling the source code into bytecode, and then passing the bytecode to the virtual machine, like Java and Python.

解释器

In computer science, an **interpreter** is a computer program that directly executes, i.e. performs instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without requiring them previously to have been compiled into a machine language program.

Interpretation and compilation are the two main means by which programming languages are implemented.

In computer science, ahead-of-time(AOT) compilation is
