Threading is a technique for decoupling tasks which are not sequentially dependent.

Running several threads is similar to running several different programs concurrently, but with the following benefits:

- Multiple threads within a process share the same data space with the main thread and can therefore share information or communicate with each other more easily

Although it is very effective for low-level threading, but the *thread* module is very limited compared to the newer threading module.

The newer threading module included with Python 2.4

Python's time module has a handy function called `sleep()`.

Essentially, as the name implies, it pauses your Python program.

比如下面这段代码，hello被打印出后，过了5s，world才会出现：

    import time
    
    
    def sleeper():
        print('hello')
        time.sleep(5)
        print('world')
    
    
    sleeper()
